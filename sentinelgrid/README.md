## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts: the backend and the frontend.

### Backend

- **src/app.js**: Entry point of the backend application. Initializes the Express app, sets up middleware, and connects to MongoDB.
- **src/controllers/index.js**: Exports controller functions for handling requests and responses.
- **src/models/index.js**: Defines MongoDB schemas and models for data storage and retrieval.
- **src/routes/index.js**: Sets up application routes and links them to controller functions.
- **src/services/aiService.js**: Contains functions that utilize AI models for threat detection and analysis.
- **src/utils/notification.js**: Utility functions for sending notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- **package.json**: Configuration file listing dependencies required for the backend application.

### Frontend

- **src/App.jsx**: Main component of the frontend application, setting up routing and rendering the layout.
- **src/components/index.jsx**: Exports reusable components used throughout the application.
- **src/pages/Home.jsx**: Represents the home page of the application.
- **src/utils/fcm.js**: Utility functions for integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging in the frontend.
- **package.json**: Configuration file listing dependencies required for the frontend application.
